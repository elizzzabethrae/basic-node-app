1. What is a node module?

A module is just a file of code that does ONE thing. You can access this file by importing/exporting it to other parts of your program. It makes debugging easy, as well as convenient for programmers because sometimes modules are already created for you.

2. Exports vs. module.exports

If you use `exports`, it is basically a convenience variable to write less code. It is not returned by require(), unlike module.exports.

If you use module.exports it returns an object from `require()`. It is empty by default but can be reassigned to many things. 

3. Why is `exports` the recommended option?

Because module.exports returns a specific object type, it is not needed unless you want that functionality.
